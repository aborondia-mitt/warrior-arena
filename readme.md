# MittBooks - [Andrew Borondia](https://cranky-beaver-6bfa9c.netlify.app) - Currently Incomplete

This is a project I made as part of the Software Developer program at the Manitoba Institute of trades and Technology.

This project is a recreation of a game that I made in Scratch several years ago when my coding knowledge was much more limited. The original game can be found [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/72038024/). I would like to recreate it using html & javascript, as well as make improvements and additions.

Here is a list of steps needed to complete the project \(which may change as I discover more things that will need to be done\):

1. Migrate original assets and upload to github - done
2. Code and test game logic \(attack/health/etc.\) - done
3. Create and render backdrop and page UI
  * Possibly add the music at this point
4. Add character images and code animation/transition logic - partially done
5. Add code to play sound effects at appropriate times in animations

Extra:

* Touch up original images and create some new & better looking text/UI/etc.
* Add new features to make game more interesting \(attack timing maybe?\)
